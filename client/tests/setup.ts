// so without this, a virtualized list always computes zero rows in range and
// renders empty regardless of how many entries are actually in state — a
// real trap hit while building the client/tests/ui tier (a full send-message
// flow looked like it silently dropped the reply). Fixed height is arbitrary,

// actually fires a callback (no real layout engine to detect a resize
// against) — so the virtualizer's internal "how tall is the scroll
// container" state stayed stuck at zero and it always computed an empty
// visible range, even once getBoundingClientRect above reported a real size.
// This fires every observed target's callback once, synchronously, with that
