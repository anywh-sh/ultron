/**
 * The relay reports these failures as codes; the wording belongs to the
 * client's dictionary. This tier is where that contract is worth pinning,
 * because the failure it guards against is exactly what shipped before:
 * `setCwd` returned an `FsError` code for four of its five outcomes and a
 * Portuguese sentence for the fifth, through a field typed `string`, and the
 * client interpolated whatever arrived straight into an alert — so a missing
 * folder told the user "not_found".
 *
 * The expected text is read from the dictionary rather than written out
 * again, so this doesn't turn into a second place where the copy lives. The
 * assertion that carries the weight is the negative one: whatever the wording
 * becomes, the raw code must never be what reaches the user.

 * Twice, because a new conversation may be applying the profile's default
 * folder, and `ChatPanel` deliberately swallows exactly one `set_cwd_error`
 * while that is in flight (an automatic attempt shouldn't raise an alert
 * nobody asked for). The second emission makes the assertion independent of
