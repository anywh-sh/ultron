/**
 * Render-cost baseline for the interactions a user performs constantly:
 * opening a conversation, switching tabs, collapsing the sidebar.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MEASURES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. This runs under happy-dom, which
 * has no layout engine — no layout, no paint, no compositing happens here.
 * What it captures is the work the app itself does: how many commits an
 * interaction costs, how much time React spends rendering them, and how many
 * DOM nodes the app holds. Those are the numbers that move when a redesign
 * makes the session list build five nodes per row instead of two, or makes
 * collapsing the sidebar re-render every mounted conversation. Anything about
 * frames — a transition on `width`, a repaint from `box-shadow`, a dropped
 * frame while dragging — is invisible here by construction and has to be
 * measured in the real app with the browser's own profiler.
 *
 * Timing comes from React's `<Profiler>` (`actualDuration`), not from a clock
 * around the interaction: wall-clock time here is dominated by user-event's
 * own event sequencing and by `waitFor`'s polling interval, which reported
 * ~120ms for a tab switch that costs the app a fraction of that. Commit counts
 * and node counts are exact and repeat run to run; the millisecond figures
 * still carry GC and scheduling noise, so treat a change under ~20% as
 * indistinguishable and compare the counts first.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of `npm test`: the `.perf.tsx` suffix doesn't match
 * vitest's default `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*` include, so only
 * `vitest.perf.config.ts` (i.e. `npm run perf`) picks it up. It prints a
 * report rather than guarding a threshold — timing assertions on shared
 * runners are how a suite becomes flaky. Run it before and after a change that
 * reshapes the UI.
