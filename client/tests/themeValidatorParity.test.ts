/**
 * `client/src/lib/theme.ts` and `relay/src/theme.ts` are the same validator,
 * duplicated because there's no shared package in this repo. Both sides have
 * to give the exact same answer about whether a theme file is broken: the
 * client validates to show a specific error without a round trip, and the
 * relay validates again because it writes the file to disk and can't trust a
 * body just because some client said it was fine.
 *
 * "Keep them in sync" lived only in a comment at the top of both files. The
 * failure that produces is quiet and one-directional — a rule tightened on
 * the client alone lets a file the client rejects get saved anyway by another
 * client, and a rule tightened on the relay alone makes a save fail with a
 * dialog that just showed no errors at all.
 *
 * Only the header comment may differ, since each copy names the other.
