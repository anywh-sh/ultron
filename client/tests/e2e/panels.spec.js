// The dock's entry points in the real Tauri window. The panes themselves
// can't be opened here: both toggles are gated on the session having a
// folder, and a folder only exists once a relay has answered — no relay runs
// in this tier. So what is provable is the gate itself, which is real
// behaviour and not a harness artifact: the controls are present and
// deliberately inert until there is something to list.
//
// Opening a pane for real (its header, maximize, the split divider) needs a
// relay and belongs to whichever tier grows one. The toggles are plain
// `<button onClick>`, not Radix triggers, so a driver click does reach them
// (unlike the dropdown triggers in shell.spec.js) — the gate is what stops
// them, nothing else.
