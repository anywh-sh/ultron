/**
 * The redesign's rules, as a test instead of as a convention.
 *
 * Two different things are guarded here, and they fail for two different
 * reasons. The performance rules (no animated layout property, one duration,
 * no `transition-all`) exist because the app's most frequent interactions —
 * tab switch, sidebar collapse, panel toggle — are exactly where a stray
 * `transition: width` costs a layout pass per frame; no test tier can measure
 * that (the unit tier runs under happy-dom, which has no layout engine), so
 * the grep is the guard. The vocabulary rules (square corners, one elevation)
 * exist because a `rounded-md` copied from a shadcn snippet is invisible in
 * review and permanent once merged.
 *
 * Scope note: the iOS shell is exempt from the shape rules, and only from
 * those. It kept its pre-existing layout — rounded cards, a pill-shaped
 * floating top bar, glass chrome that lifts off the content — because the
 * redesign covered desktop only; repainting half of a screen that nobody can
 * validate from a Linux box produces a worse result than leaving it whole.
