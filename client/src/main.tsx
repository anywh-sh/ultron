// The WebdriverIO Tauri stack has three halves that all have to match: the
// `tauri-plugin-wdio` crate (gated behind the `e2e` Cargo feature), the
// `@wdio/tauri-service` test-side service, and this frontend plugin, whose
// only job is to snapshot `window.__TAURI__.core` into
// `window.__wdio_original_core__` before anything can wrap it in a Proxy.
// Only the first two were ever wired up, and the missing third one is not
// inert: the service's per-command focus probe invokes
// `plugin:wdio|get_window_states` through that global, so every single
// element lookup a spec made waited out a 5s timeout (~10s once nested) and
// then gave up. Two lookups still fit inside mocha's 60s budget, which is
// why the smoke test kept passing while any richer spec died of a bare
// "Error: Timeout" that pointed at nothing.
//
// Gated on a Vite mode rather than a shell env var so it works the same on
// Windows and macOS: `import.meta.env.VITE_E2E` is set only by
// `vite build --mode e2e` (.env.e2e), so for a normal dev/build this is a
// statically false branch that Vite drops, import and all.
//
// Deliberately not awaited: the service polls for the global every 10ms for
// up to 5s, so it does not need to exist before the first paint — and
// blocking startup on a test-only dynamic import would distort the very
// boot behaviour this tier is here to exercise.
