 * outside React and subscribed to from a hook.
 *
 * It exists because the sidebar lists every profile at once now. Before,
 * `useSessionNames` held the active profile's list in `useState` (thrown
 * away on every profile switch) and the search dialog refetched every
 * profile from scratch each time it opened (kept nothing). Neither survives
 * a profile switch, let alone a restart, so neither can back a list that is
 * supposed to show profiles the user is not currently connected to.
 *
 * The deliberate non-goal: this never fetches anything. Writes come from
 * whoever already had a reason to talk to a relay — the active profile's
 * own fetch and live socket, or the one-time bootstrap for a profile that
 * has never been synced on this device. Nothing here fans out across
 * profiles on a timer, because waking every profile at once is exactly the
 * cost this design is avoiding.
