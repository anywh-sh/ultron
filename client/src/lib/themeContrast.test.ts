/**
 * Contrast of the two built-in themes, measured instead of eyeballed.
 *
 * The light theme is what makes this worth a test: the dark one was looked at
 * on every screen while it was being built, and a light theme is where a
 * color chosen against a near-black surface quietly stops being readable. A
 * ratio is also the one property of a palette that a human reviewer cannot
 * estimate — 3.2 and 4.6 look equally fine side by side on a good monitor,
 * and only one of them is legible on a laptop screen at an airport.
 *
 * The bar is WCAG 2.1's 4.5:1 for text (1.4.3), with no large-text exemption
 * claimed anywhere: most of the faint text in this app is 10–11px, which is
 * the opposite of large. The one lower bar is syntax highlighting, argued for
 * where it is applied.
