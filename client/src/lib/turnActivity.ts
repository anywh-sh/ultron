/**
 * How many tools the agent has reached for since the user last spoke — what
 * the turn indicator reports while a turn is in flight.
 *
 * "Since the user last spoke" is the definition of the current turn that the
 * log can actually answer: tool-use entries carry no timestamp of their own,
 * so there is nothing to compare against the turn's start instant. Walking
 * back to the most recent user message gets the same answer without adding
 * a field to the wire format for a counter.
 *
 * Counts `tool-use`, not `tool-result`: a call that is still running is one
 * the user wants counted — that is precisely the one explaining the wait.
