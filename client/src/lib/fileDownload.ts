 * The native save dialog grants the fs plugin write access to whatever path
 * it returns without a broader `fs` scope (Tauri v2: the selected path is
 * added to the fs/asset-protocol scopes for the picked path only), so the
 * `fs:allow-write-file` capability here never has to allow arbitrary paths.
 * `null` back from `save()` means the user cancelled — a no-op, not an
 * error. Returns whether a file was actually written, so a caller reporting
 * "downloaded" to the user (the toast in `DownloadToasts.tsx`) doesn't fire
 * on a cancelled dialog.

 * logged and counted, so one broken symlink doesn't lose everything else
 * already fetched; the caller finds out via the thrown summary and can alert.

 * live count (`DownloadToasts.tsx`) without this function knowing anything
