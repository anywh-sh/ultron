 * How this device reaches the profile, as one word.

 * anything about who is hosting or paying for it: a profile dialled straight
 * at a host is local, one reached through the tailnet is remote, and one the
 * account owner has disconnected is revoked regardless of either.
 *
 * Shared by the profile switcher and the settings navigation so the word
 * means the same thing in both — the two places that list every profile.
