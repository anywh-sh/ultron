 * `index.css`'s `:root` block paints the very first frame — before any JS
 * runs, so before `themeApply.ts` can write a single custom property — and is
 * also the fallback for every token a custom theme leaves undeclared.
 * `DEFAULT_THEME` is the same palette expressed as data. Nothing enforced
 * that the two agreed: the rule lived in a comment in both files, and drifting
 * them apart produces a bug that only shows for the fraction of a second
 * before the first paint, or only on a token a custom theme happens to omit.
