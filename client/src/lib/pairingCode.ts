 * Self-describing pairing codes — `<join-code>@<host>` (e.g.
 * `ABCDEF-GHJKMNPQ@example.com`), the typed counterpart of the
 * `ultron://import-profile` deep link (profileImport.ts).
 *
 * Why the host is part of the code at all: a bare join code is meaningless
 * without knowing *where* to redeem it, and this client is not allowed to
 * know that — the whole point of the deep link carrying `claimUrl` as
 * opaque data (journal/62 CT-1) is that no route of any particular hosted
 * service is ever hardcoded here. Baking a host in as the only alternative
 * would hardcode one deployment into a self-hostable client. So the code
 * carries its own host, and the host says where its endpoints are, via the
 * discovery document below.
 *
 * The host stays visible in plaintext on purpose: whoever types the code
 * can see which machine is about to receive their device's public key.

 * service conforms to this spec, this client never learns that service's
 * own route names.
