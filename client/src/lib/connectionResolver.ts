/**
 * Turns a `Profile` into something a hook/module outside the chat WebSocket
 * can actually dial — the single place every one of them (sidebar, files,
 * terminal, theme/profile sync) goes through instead of reading
 * `profile.host`/`profile.relayPort` straight (journal/62, "todo tráfego que
 * não é o WebSocket do chat"). A direct profile resolves from its own
 * fields, synchronously in spirit (wrapped in a promise only for one
 * call-site shape). A tailnet profile needs two independent things:
 *
 * - The sidecar's local address — peeked from whichever owner already has
 *   it running (`useTailnetSidecarOwner` at the App level, or a chat tab's
 *   `useRelayClient`), never re-acquired here: an acquire+release around
 *   every call would tear the join down between calls whenever nothing else
 *   holds a reference, refiring the whole `tsnet` join on the next one
 *   (tens of seconds, journal/62). Only when nobody already owns it (e.g. a
 *   tailnet profile queried one-off, like `useAllSessionNames`'s
 *   cross-profile search) does this fall back to acquiring just for the
 *   call and releasing right after.
 * - A brand-new broker grant for the token — never reused (journal/49 D4):
 *   the proxy spends every connect token's `jti` on the first request of
 *   the TCP connection it authorizes (`edge/internal/proxy/server.go`), so
 *   every new connection through the tunnel needs its own unspent one.
