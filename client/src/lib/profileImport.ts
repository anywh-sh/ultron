 * (`host`/`port` to reach it directly, an optional `token` for a reverse
 * proxy gating access) or their own broker (a `claimUrl` to redeem a code
 * against, a `brokerUrl` to ask for connections afterward — CT-1).
 * `DEFAULT_PROFILES`'s own comment in profiles.ts already anticipated a
 * flow like this calling `addProfile`.
 *
 * `resolvePairingCodeParams` below is the same tailnet mode reached from a
 * typed `<join-code>@<host>` code instead of a link — it resolves the same
 * fields through discovery, without spending the code itself; the caller
 * hands the result to `claimAndSaveProfile` to actually redeem it.
