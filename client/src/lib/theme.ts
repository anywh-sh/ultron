// trip; the relay validates again because it writes the file to disk and
// can't trust a body just because some client said it was fine.
//
// The validator reports a CODE, never a sentence: both sides run it, and the
// relay's copy of an error travels back in the HTTP error body to land in the
// same list the client's own errors do. See `ThemeValidationError`.
