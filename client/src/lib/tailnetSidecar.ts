 * running (journal/62 F3: e.g. a second tab on a brokered profile, which

 *
 * The actual teardown is deferred, not immediate, by `graceMs`. The default
 * (`0`) exists for React 18 StrictMode (dev only), which double-invokes the
 * effect that owns this profile's sidecar — mount, cleanup, mount again —
 * all synchronously, before the first `tsnet` join has had any chance to
 * finish. Tearing down on that first cleanup killed the join mid-flight
 * every time, so the second mount always started cold, and any caller ahead
 * of the second `acquireTailnetSidecar` (the chat `RelayClient`,
 * `useSessionNames`, ...) was left racing a WebSocket against a sidecar with
 * no port yet — this is the concrete bug behind the client connecting to
 * `127.0.0.1:0` and looping on "reconnecting" forever. `0` is enough for
 * that case: StrictMode's mount/cleanup/mount replay happens inside the same
 * tick, well before any timer fires, so a genuine same-profile reacquire
 * always lands before this runs and cancels it (see `acquireTailnetSidecar`).
 *
 * A non-zero `graceMs` covers a slower handover: `profileSetup.ts`'s
 * `ProfileSetupDialog` holds a reference across "Continuar para novo
 * perfil", and the real new owner (`useTailnetSidecarOwner`) only reclaims
 * it after a passive-effect flush plus its own internal deferral plus a
 * round-trip to the broker — far more than one tick. Either way, only a
 * real "nobody wants this anymore" reaches the timeout body. */
