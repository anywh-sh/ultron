   * count from when it found out, not the real start, underestimating the
   * time already elapsed. For whoever sent it, `ChatPanel` already fills
   * this in optimistically (`Date.now()` on the send click), so in practice
   * it's always "now" for that tab — the difference only shows up for
   * whoever didn't start it.
   *
   * `null` when idle — on desktop this doesn't unmount the component:
   * it goes `invisible` instead, keeping its rendered height
   * permanently reserved so `MessageLog`'s `flex-1` area never resizes when
   * a turn starts or ends. It used to mount/unmount, which shrank that area
   * an instant before the scroll container's `ResizeObserver` caught up,
   * clipping the last bubble under this indicator for a frame. */
