 * Vertical rhythm between entries in the log, and nothing else.
 *
 * It used to draw a coloured rail down the left of tool calls and errors.
 * The design has no rails: a tool call is already a bordered card, and the
 * rail was a second frame around something that was framed — what it marked
 * was legible without it. An error says it is an error in its own tone.
 *
 * Memoized — see comment on `Message.tsx::UserBubble`. Without this, the
 * wrapper would reconcile (and the memoized child inside it would bail out
 * too late) on every `MessageLog` render, even with `children` unchanged.
