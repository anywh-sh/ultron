 * would re-render every mounted tab if `App` held it (see titleBarSlot.ts) —
 * this needs nothing `App` doesn't already have: the relay resolves the
 * folder from the session id, so the id of the focused tab is the whole
 * input. Rendering it straight from `App` is both simpler and cheaper here.
 *
 * Nothing polls. The answer is re-asked on the three events that can change
 * it — the focused session, its turn state, and the window regaining focus
 * — because every ask spawns a `git status` on the host, and a timer doing
 * that in the background for a folder nobody is looking at is exactly the
 * kind of cost this redesign is not allowed to add.
