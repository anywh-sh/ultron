 * The mark: a filled accent square with a chevron and a bar cut out of it.

 * Both colors are literal hex, matching `assets/logo.svg` (the static brand
 * asset) exactly — deliberately not `--primary`/`--primary-foreground`,
 * which are the *active theme's* accent and vary with it (`--primary` alone
 * differs between the two built-in themes). The mark is brand identity, not
 * UI chrome: it stays the same two colors regardless of which theme is on
 * screen, the same way the mark doesn't take `currentColor` either — a mark
 * that recolored with its surroundings would stop being the mark.
