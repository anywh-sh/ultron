/**
 * Everything a tab's panel needs to call back into `App`, as one object
 * built once (`useMemo` there) instead of a closure per tab per render.
 *
 * Every callback takes what it operates on as an argument — the tab, the
 * profile, the path — and closes over nothing that changes. That is the
 * whole point: it lets `TabPanel` below be `memo`'d, and it means none of
 * these can go stale. The two values that made the old inline closures
 * unmemoizable (`windowFocused` and the active tab id, both read at the
 * moment a turn finishes rather than at render time) are read from refs on
 * the `App` side for the same reason.

  // and IT (internally, lightweight) is what decides the width (0 closed,

  // return chatContent` with no wrapper at all), and
  // opening/closing/switching the terminal tab changed the type of the child
  // at that position in the tree (from `ChatPanel` directly to `div`) —
  // React saw that as a different element and unmounted the whole
  // `ChatPanel` (losing `ready`, closing the WS, reconnecting), which is
  // exactly the skeleton flash reported when opening/expanding/closing the
