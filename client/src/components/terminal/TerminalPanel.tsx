/**
 * Terminal-specific content, plugged into the generic `SessionPanel` shell.
 * Only mounts while the chat tab that owns it is active AND the panel is
 * marked open (decided by the caller, see App.tsx) — this conditional
 * mount/unmount is what implements "switching sessions closes the panel on
 * its own, coming back reopens it the way it was": unmounting closes each
 * terminal tab's WS (the relay only detaches from tmux, never kills the
 * session because of it — see terminalSession.ts), remounting reconnects
 * and tmux redraws the screen on its own.
 *
 * All of the panel's terminal tabs stay mounted at the same time
 * (`forceMount`, same trick as `TabBar.tsx`) — only the whole panel
 * connects/disconnects on entering/leaving focus, switching between
 * terminal tabs inside an already-open panel is instant, no reconnecting.
 * The number of tabs per panel tends to be small (a handful), so the cost
 * of keeping them all alive is low — quite different from keeping *every*
 * chat session's terminal alive, which is exactly what the conditional
 * mounting above avoids.

   * effect, not two: the first version fired both in sequence in the same
   * pass — `addTerminal` already sets a synchronous flag before the new
   * state (`tabs`) has re-rendered, so a separate "close if empty" effect
   * would read `tabs.length` still as 0 and close the panel an instant
   * after opening (found while actually testing: opening always ended up

   * seeded two tabs ("Terminal 1" and "Terminal 2") instead of one, with the
   * second call's `addTerminal` left active (found while testing: the panel
