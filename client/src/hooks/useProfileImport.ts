/**
 * Listens for `anywh://import-profile` deep links (see profileImport.ts
 * for the URL format, src-tauri/tauri.conf.json for the OS-registered
 * scheme) and hands each one to `profileSetup.ts`'s queue — no callback out
 * of this hook anymore (decision 1: nothing here switches profile, or does
 * anything else React-observable, on its own).
 *
 * Two delivery paths, both handled: `getCurrent()` covers a cold launch
 * (the OS started the app *because* of the link — the common case for a
 * pairing flow, since the app usually isn't running yet), `onOpenUrl` covers
 * the link arriving while the app is already open. `onOpenUrl` needs the
 * single-instance plugin to fire at all on Windows/Linux (the OS spawns a
 * second process and hands it the URL as a CLI argument instead of
 * notifying the running one) — now wired up in src-tauri/src/lib.rs with
 * the plugin's `deep-link` feature, so all three desktop platforms deliver
 * both paths.
 *
 * Neither path is the only way in: `AddRemoteMachineDialog` feeds the same
 * queue from a typed pairing code, for whoever has a code but no working
 * link (a platform where `anywh://` isn't registered, a browser that
 * swallowed it, a code read off another screen).

    // one tick. The claim itself moved out of this hook (profileSetup.ts's

    // join code from ever being redeemed twice now) — but calling

    // that gets silently deduped a moment later, on every cold launch.
