 * agent screen slides to the right — gaining a subtle border, rounded
 * corners, and gradually losing opacity as it slides — and the
 * sidebar appears behind it. The live drag manipulates the DOM directly via ref
 * (no re-render per pixel); only the `open` state toggles the CSS's
 * `.pushed` class, which animates to the settled state.
 *
 * Real finding from testing on a physical device: a drag that starts inside an
 * area with its own scroll (vertical log, horizontal code block) can
 * get "stolen" by WebKit's native scroll mid-gesture — when
 * that happens, the browser fires `pointercancel`, not `pointerup`. Without
 * handling this separately, the listeners were never removed and the canvas got
 * stuck in an intermediate state (only a tap, via `onBlockerPointerDown`,
 * could "unstick" it). Every `pointerup` below has a sibling `pointercancel`
 * that does the same cleanup.
