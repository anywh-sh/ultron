/**
 * OS window focus — distinct from "active tab within the app". Used to
 * decide whether a conversation is actually visible to the user (switching tabs
 * within the app + alt-tabbing to another app are the two ways of "not looking").
 * Outside Tauri, always assumes focused (no API to check, and it's not the
 * context where the turn-complete notification fires anyway).
 *
 * On iOS uses `document.visibilityState`/`visibilitychange` instead of Tauri's
 * window focus API — real finding (Simulator spike, docs/37): "window"
 * focus there maps to UIKit's `applicationWillResignActive`/
 * `DidBecomeActive` pair, which fires for any momentary
 * interruption (Control Center, a system alert, the native notification
 * permission prompt itself) — not just when the app actually goes to the
 * background for real. Practical result: turn-complete notification firing
 * even with the user looking straight at the screen, because `windowFocused`
 * blipped to `false` for an instant unrelated to real backgrounding. Meanwhile
 * `document.hidden` is the standard web API precisely for "the page is
 * genuinely out of view", and only becomes `true` on the real background
 * transition in WKWebView (confirmed in the same spike: fires shortly before
 * the process gets suspended, not on focus blips). Desktop keeps Tauri's
 * window API (there, "losing focus" IS the correct signal — alt-tabbing to another
 * app should indeed count as "not looking", unlike iOS). */
