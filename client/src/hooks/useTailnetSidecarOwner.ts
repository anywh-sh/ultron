/**
 * Holds one sidecar reference for as long as `profile` is in play at the
 * App level — sidebar, profile sync, and theme sync (journal/62, "todo
 * tráfego que não é o WebSocket do chat") all run against `activeProfile`
 * before any chat tab for it ever mounts, and until now only a chat tab's
 * `useRelayClient` ever acquired a reference. Mount this once, high in the
 * tree, for whichever profile(s) those App-level hooks are reading — it
 * shares the same ref-counted map as `useRelayClient` (`tailnetSidecar.ts`),
 * so a chat tab open on the same profile just adds a second reference, and
 * tearing one down never affects the other's join.
 *
 * Doesn't expose the endpoint itself — consumers go through
 * `resolveConnection` (`connectionResolver.ts`), which peeks whatever this
 * hook (or a chat tab) already has running.
