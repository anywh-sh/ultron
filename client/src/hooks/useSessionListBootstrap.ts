/**
 * Fills in the session list of profiles this device has never synced, once
 * each, and then never again.
 *
 * This used to be `useAllSessionNames`, which refetched every profile from
 * scratch each time Cmd+K opened. With the sidebar listing every profile at
 * once, that shape is both insufficient (the sidebar needs the rows before
 * anyone opens a search dialog) and wrong: a fan-out that repeats is the one
 * pattern this design deliberately avoids, since reaching a profile can mean
 * waking a machine that was asleep.
 *
 * What remains is a one-shot per profile per device. Everything after that
 * rides on connections the app was already making anyway: the active
 * profile's own fetch and live socket (`useSessionNames`), which follow the
 * user switching profiles or focusing a tab that belongs to another one.
 * A profile added later is picked up by the same rule — it starts with no
 * `syncedAt`, so it bootstraps when it appears, not on a timer. The active
 * profile is left out entirely, since `useSessionNames` already syncs it.
