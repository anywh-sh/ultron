# Configuration

Every setting on both sides, what it defaults to, and when you actually need
to change it. Nothing here is required — a relay started from a shell that
already has your agent CLI on PATH runs on defaults alone.

## Where settings live

The relay reads, in increasing order of precedence:

1. `relay/.env` — shared by every profile on the machine. Put machine-wide
   things here: `AGENT_BIN`, `EXTRA_PATH_DIRS`.
2. `~/.config/anywh/env/<profile>.env` — one file per profile, written by
   `add-profile.sh`. Put per-profile things here: `RELAY_PORT`,
   `RELAY_HOME_OVERRIDE`.
3. A real environment variable, which always wins over both.

The same two files work whether you run `npm start` from a shell (loaded via
Node's `--env-file-if-exists`) or under systemd (loaded via
`EnvironmentFile=`). Neither is committed; both are gitignored.

## Relay

### Agent process

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_BIN` | `claude`, resolved via PATH | Absolute path to your agent CLI's binary. Set it whenever the relay's own PATH can't resolve the bare name — which is most of the time under systemd, since the service never sources your shell profile. |
| `EXTRA_PATH_DIRS` | — | Colon-separated directories prepended to the PATH of every spawned agent process, for tools the agent itself invokes (`node`, `git`, a version manager's shim directory). Same PATH problem as above, one level down. |
| `RELAY_HOME_OVERRIDE` | your real `$HOME` | Overrides `$HOME` for the spawned agent, which is how one machine runs several isolated logins. See [Profiles](./profiles.md). |
| `TMUX_BIN` | the standard system path | Absolute path to `tmux`, used by the terminal panel. |

`CLAUDE_BIN` is the former name of `AGENT_BIN`. It still works so an
existing `.env` survives an upgrade untouched, but it's deprecated — use
`AGENT_BIN` in anything new.

The relay strips the provider's API key from the environment of every agent
process it spawns. That is deliberate and not configurable: it guarantees
usage bills against the subscription the CLI is logged into, never
pay-per-token.

### Network

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `RELAY_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface the relay binds to. `0.0.0.0` listens everywhere — read the [security model](../README.md#security-model) before you do, because the relay is unauthenticated and defaults to a permission-skipping agent. A tailnet IP is usually what you want instead. |
| `RELAY_PORT` | `8765` | Port for the HTTP/WebSocket server. Give each profile on a machine its own. |

### State on disk

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `RELAY_SESSIONS_FILE` | per-profile path | Where session and tab state is persisted across restarts. |
| `RELAY_BACKGROUND_JOBS_FILE` | per-profile path | Where background-job state is persisted. |
| `RELAY_UPLOAD_DIR` | a temporary directory | Where files sent from the client (pasted images and the like) are written. |
| `RELAY_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS` | `240000` (4 minutes) | How long a restart or shutdown waits for in-flight turns to finish before forcing them closed. |

### Open in editor

The file panel's "open in editor" action is hidden unless one of these is
set. Locality is declared here rather than inferred from the connecting
peer's address, because the address genuinely doesn't settle the question: a
loopback peer can be this machine or a tunnel terminating on it, and a
tailnet-IP peer can still be this same physical box.

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ANYWH_EDITOR_LOCAL` | Set to `1` when clients connect to this relay *from this same machine*. Opens paths with a local deep link (`zed://file…`, `vscode://file…`). Honored only when the request's peer address really is this machine. |
| `ANYWH_EDITOR_SSH` | Set to an SSH target when clients connect *from a different machine* — the client dials it from its own end using the editor's SSH-remote deep link. Anything `ssh` accepts works, including a `~/.ssh/config` alias, which is usually the least friction. `user@host` or `user@host:2222`. |

## Client

Read by Vite at build time, so changing them requires a rebuild — they do
not hot-reload. Both optional; with neither set the client looks for a relay
at `127.0.0.1:8765`.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_ANYWH_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host or IP of the relay machine. |
| `VITE_ANYWH_PORT` | `8765` | Port the relay listens on — match the relay's `RELAY_PORT`. |

On desktop you can override the profile list at runtime from DevTools
instead of rebuilding; see
[Self-hosting](./self-hosting.md#pointing-the-client-at-your-relay). iOS has
no DevTools, so on iOS these are the only build-time route.
