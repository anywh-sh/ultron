# Self-hosting

The full install, in the order you actually do it: get the relay running on
the machine your agent lives on, then point a client at it.

If all you want is the happy path, the three steps in the
[README](../README.md#quick-start) are the short version of this page.

## Before you start

The relay does not install your agent for you, and the install script stops
rather than guessing. On the machine that will run it:

- **Node.js 20.12 or newer.** The install script checks the version and
  refuses to continue below it.
- **An agent CLI, already logged in.** The relay spawns whatever binary it
  is pointed at and inherits that login — it never holds a credential of its
  own. Log in once, out of band, before anything else.
- **Linux or Apple Silicon macOS** for the packaged relay. Intel Macs have
  no published build; on Windows, run the relay inside WSL2. The *client* is
  a separate matter and ships for Windows, macOS and Linux.
- **`tmux`**, if you want the integrated terminal panel.

## Installing the relay

### The install script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://anywh.sh/install | sh
```

It downloads the release tarball for your platform, verifies it against the
release's `SHA256SUMS`, unpacks it to `~/.local/share/anywh`, and renders a
systemd user unit so the relay survives reboots. Re-running it upgrades in
place and never touches profile state.

Override the destination with `ANYWH_INSTALL_DIR` if `~/.local/share/anywh`
isn't where you want it.

The script always installs the latest release; there's no version pin yet.

### From source

Useful when you're changing the relay, not just running it.

```bash
cd relay
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # optional — see Configuration
npm run build
npm start               # or `npm run dev` to run from TypeScript directly
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:8765` unless told otherwise. Every setting is
optional and documented in [Configuration](./configuration.md); the common
one is `AGENT_BIN`, needed when your agent CLI isn't resolvable by bare name
from the relay's own PATH.

Running it as a service instead of from a shell is covered in
[`infra/systemd/README.md`](../infra/systemd/README.md).

## Installing the client

### Prebuilt

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/anywh-sh/anywh/releases/latest)
and install it like any other app: `.msi`/`.exe` on Windows, `.dmg` on
macOS, `.AppImage`/`.deb`/`.rpm` on Linux.

### From source

Needs the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
for your OS — a Rust toolchain plus platform system libraries — and a Go
toolchain, which the build uses for a bundled helper binary and invokes for
you. Any Go from 1.21 on works; the exact version the helper pins is fetched
automatically.

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run tauri dev     # full desktop app
npm run dev           # Vite only, in a browser, without Tauri APIs
```

`npm run dev` alone needs neither Go nor Rust — it serves the frontend in a
browser without Tauri APIs, which is enough for pure UI work.

## Pointing the client at your relay

A fresh client assumes the relay is on the same machine
(`127.0.0.1:8765`). Three ways to change that, in descending order of how
often you'll want them.

**Pairing code or deep link.** The right answer when the relay isn't
directly addressable — behind NAT, or on a tailnet. In the profile switcher,
**add remote machine**, then paste a `CODE@host` pairing code; an
`anywh://import-profile` deep link does the same with nothing typed. Both
require the relay side to implement the two endpoints in the
[pairing protocol](./pairing.md). The client hardcodes no server.

**Build-time environment variables.** Works everywhere, including iOS, and
is the only option on iOS.

```bash
cd client
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_ANYWH_HOST / VITE_ANYWH_PORT
npm run tauri dev
```

Vite reads these at build time — editing `.env` needs a rebuild, it will not
hot-reload.

**`localStorage` override.** Desktop only, since it needs DevTools, but it
needs no rebuild. In the console:

```js
localStorage.setItem("anywh:profiles", JSON.stringify([
  { id: "default", label: "Default", host: "127.0.0.1", relayPort: 8765 },
]));
```

then reload.

## Creating your first profile

A profile is the agent login the relay serves — you need at least one before
there is anything to talk to.

### In the app

With nothing set up yet, the client opens on a first-run screen that walks
you through it: reach the relay, confirm the agent login it found, name the
profile. This is the path to take. Later profiles are added the same way,
from the profile switcher.

### From the command line

The same provisioning the app performs, if you would rather do it on the
machine itself — or if you are setting the relay up headless, before any
client has ever connected to it.

```bash
~/.local/share/anywh/infra/systemd/add-profile.sh default \
  --relay-host <the address other devices will reach this machine on>
```

`--relay-host` is required for the very first profile, because there is no
existing profile to copy a default from. Use the machine's LAN IP, or its address on
your private network if you will connect from outside the house — see
[Remote access](./remote-access.md).

Running more than one agent login on the same machine is
[Profiles](./profiles.md), and
[`infra/systemd/README.md`](../infra/systemd/README.md) covers the full set
of flags and the systemd instance behind each profile.

## iOS

```bash
cd client
npm run ios:device                  # Simulator, or prompts for a connected device
npm run ios:device -- "My iPhone"   # a specific physical device
```

iOS has no DevTools, so the build-time environment variables above are the
only way to point an iOS build at a relay short of pairing. If you always
target the same device, drop a gitignored `*.local.sh` wrapper in `client/`
instead of retyping the name.
