// titleGenerator.ts, suggestionGenerator.ts) — same binary, same PATH
// problem for all of them.
//
// Absolute path and explicit PATH: running via systemd the process doesn't
// have the user's interactive shell PATH (doesn't source .bashrc/.profile),
// so neither the binary nor tools it invokes internally (node, git...) would
// be found by name alone — same bug class already fixed for tmux.
// Defaults to the bare command name, which works whenever the relay itself
// is started from a shell that already has the agent CLI on PATH (e.g. `npm
// run dev`); override via env for systemd or any other PATH-less launch.
//
// `CLAUDE_BIN` is the pre-rename name, still honored so an existing
// deployment's .env keeps working across an upgrade without being edited.
// It is deprecated: `AGENT_BIN` is the documented name, and the fallback
// chain below is the only place that should ever mention the old one.

// the agent manually just as well.
//
// Scoped to the provider whose CLI this relay actually spawns, not every
// provider that exists. A blanket `*_API_KEY` sweep would also strip a key a
// project's own tooling legitimately needs inside a turn, which is not this
// rule's business. Teaching the relay a second agent CLI means adding that
