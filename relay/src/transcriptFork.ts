/**
 * Message editing (docs/33) — truncates the `.jsonl` file that the Claude
 * Code CLI maintains on its own, at the exact point of the message the user
 * edited, and writes the result as a new session (new `session_id`). This is
 * the only real way to "restart the conversation from here": the `claude`
 * CLI has no "resume cutting in the middle" flag (confirmed in `--help`:
 * only `--resume`/`--fork-session`, always from the tip) — without this, the
 * next `--resume` would reread the whole file (old message + everything that
 * came after) and send that "wrong" history to the API, even with the UI
 * already hiding the edited message.
 *
 * `turnsToKeep` is the count of turns (`user` lines with genuine human text,
 * same criterion as `transcriptReader.ts`) that must survive the cut —
 * computed by the caller (`SharedSession`) from the in-memory `history`,
 * which is what knows how to distinguish a synthetic `anywh-bg` turn from a
 * real one (the file itself doesn't mark that difference). Since each turn,
 * real or synthetic, corresponds to exactly one `claude -p` call and
 * therefore exactly one line in the `.jsonl`, counting the same way on both
 * sides always matches — no need to reconstruct the real/synthetic
 * distinction here.
