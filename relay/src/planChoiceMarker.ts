// workaround. The format below was validated against the real binary
// (Descoberta 2) — the model reliably discriminates it from an open-ended
// request for detail and only uses it for a genuinely closed decision. It's
// a weaker guarantee than tool-calling (depends on the model choosing to
// follow the format), but plan mode is inherently textual anyway — it
// produces a written plan, not tool calls — so parsing text here isn't a
// workaround, it's the native shape that mode already speaks in (docs/46,
// "Decisão de design: abordagem híbrida por modo").

 * there's no live `claude` process holding a tool call open to return an
 * answer to (the turn that asked already ended, or ended immediately after
 * asking), so the answer becomes the next ordinary user message instead,
 * same as if they'd typed it in the composer themselves
 * (`SharedSession.answerChoice` enqueues it as a real turn). Kept in
 * Portuguese on purpose, like `buildBackgroundJobFollowupPrompt` in
 * sharedSession.ts — this is the literal text of a synthetic user turn, so
 * its language is what the model's reply (shown to the user) will follow. */
