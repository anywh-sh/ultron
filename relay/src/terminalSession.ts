// child_process without a PTY won't do). tmux is what guarantees genuine
// persistence: closing the WS connection just sends SIGHUP to the local
// process (which tmux treats as a *detach*, not as killing the session —
// same behavior as closing a real terminal with tmux inside), and a relay
// restart (e.g. deploying new code) doesn't bring down the open shells,
// because the tmux server runs independently of the relay process. The
// relay keeps no in-memory record of which terminal is alive — tmux is the
// source of truth, queried on demand (list-sessions) when needed.

/** Spawns (or reattaches to, via `-A`) this terminal tab's tmux session.

 * ignores `cwd` on purpose (that's normal terminal behavior: an
 * already-running shell's folder doesn't teleport if the conversation's
 * working directory changes later; whoever wants another folder does `cd`
 * by hand or opens a new tab).
 *
 * `-f /dev/null` is essential, not cosmetic: an isolated socket (`-L`) only
 * separates *sessions* — tmux still loads the real `~/.tmux.conf` for ANY
 * new server that comes up, regardless of socket. Without `-f /dev/null`, a
 * `mouse on` (or anything else) in the user's personal config leaked into
 * the embedded terminal — that's what caused tmux's `[0/0]` copy-mode
 * indicator to show up when selecting text with the mouse (finding from
 * testing).
 *
 * The chained `; set-option ...` (literal `;` token — no shell in between,
 * `pty.spawn` receives raw argv, so it's not shell syntax, it's tmux itself
 * recognizing `;` as a command separator) locks in the behavior we want,
 * without depending on any config: `status off` (otherwise a "junk" line
 * shows up with truncated session id + hostname + time, tmux chrome
 * duplicating the app's tab strip) and explicit `mouse off` (already
 * tmux's default without a config, but documented here — it's what
 * guarantees text selection is always xterm.js-native, never tmux's
 * copy-mode). `-g` (global, not per-session) guarantees this holds both
 * when creating and when reattaching: an explicit `-t <name>` would only
 * take effect on creation, like `-c` above. */
