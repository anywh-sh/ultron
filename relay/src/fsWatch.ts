/**
 * One instance per `/files` WS connection (docs/41 phase 5) — tracks
 * exactly the directories/files the client says are visible right now
 * (expanded tree nodes + open tabs) and keeps a non-recursive `fs.watch`
 * open for each; recursive watching doesn't scale once `node_modules` is
 * involved (measured, docs/41), so only what's actually on screen gets a
 * watcher. `update` always receives the client's *full* current set, not an
 * incremental add/remove — it diffs against what's already watched and
 * opens/closes only the difference, which makes it idempotent and immune to
 * the client and relay ever disagreeing about state.
