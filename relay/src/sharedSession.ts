   * answer becomes a brand new turn instead of resolving anything in flight.
   * This is the field whose lifecycle INVERTED with this feature: it used to
   * be force-cleared by `runTurn`'s `finally` same as `pendingApproval` still

   * simply has no pending approval, which is correct. `pendingChoice` is the
   * one case where a restart now has real (if rare) user-visible cost — an
   * unanswered `present_choice`/plan-marker prompt just disappears, same as
   * it silently already did for the plan-marker case since Fase 3. Accepted
   * rather than persisted (no `sessionStore.ts` entry): the conversation
   * itself survives a restart fine via the persisted `session_id`, the human
   * only loses the one pending question and can just ask the model to repeat

    // the CLI's MCP tool search can leave `present_choice` listed by name

    // the model to `ToolSearch` for it before calling it was observed live

    // prompt-adherence gap no wording reliably closes. `alwaysLoad: true`
    // sidesteps the model's choice entirely: the CLI docs confirm it keeps
    // a server's tools out of deferral regardless of `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH`,
    // so both tools arrive with full schema already loaded, same as a
    // built-in tool — nothing to discover, nothing to forget to search for.
