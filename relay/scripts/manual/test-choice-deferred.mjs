// Manual validation for the docs/46 deferred-lifecycle rework of
// `present_choice`. The automated suite (relay/tests/choiceDeferred.test.ts)
// already proves the mechanism works end to end against the real
// McpChoiceBridge/HTTP stack, but with a FAKE `claude` making the tool call
// deterministically — it can't prove the REAL model actually reads the new
// `tool_result` ("end your turn now...") and behaves accordingly. That part
// is probabilistic (model behavior, not our code), so it only means anything
// tested against the real binary. Run from `relay/`, with the relay already
// up (`npm run dev`): `node scripts/manual/test-choice-deferred.mjs`.
//
// What this checks:
//   1. The turn completes quickly after the model calls `present_choice` —
//      NOT after minutes, and NOT hanging until the CLI's ~6-minute MCP
//      timeout (journal/46 Descoberta 8, the bug this whole rework exists to
//      route around). Under the old blocking design this exact scenario
//      (nobody answers right away) is what used to eventually fail with
//      "The operation timed out".
//   2. A `choice_prompt` was broadcast with the expected question.
//   3. Waiting past the point where a human would plausibly still be
//      reading the prompt (here: a few seconds — the point isn't to
//      reproduce the full 6-minute wait, it's to prove elapsed time doesn't
//      matter anymore because the turn ISN'T waiting on anything), then
//      answering, correctly starts a brand new turn whose response reflects
//      the answer.
