### A self-hosted remote control for your coding agents — chat, voice, and a file browser from any device, while they keep running on your own machine

**Agent-agnostic by design** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, and more

## Why

Your coding agent runs where your code already is — a home server, an always-on desktop, the work machine with every repo checked out and every credential in place. That is the right place for it. Then you leave the house.

SSH from a phone is the usual answer and it is miserable: no voice input, no dragging a screenshot into the conversation, no formatting that survives a small screen. The official apps fix all of that by moving the session into their cloud — a different machine, a different checkout, a different billing model.

anywh moves nothing. It is a relay between a real client app and the agent CLI already installed on your machine: the process keeps running where it always ran, logged in the way it already is, and the app is just a better way to reach it from whatever device you have on you. No API key is ever involved: the relay strips the provider's API key from the environment of the process it spawns, so usage counts against the subscription you already pay for, never pay-per-token.

Self-hosted and used daily by its author: chat, voice, image upload, multi-session, multi-profile, an integrated terminal, and a file browser — validated on Windows, macOS and iOS.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Status |
|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) | Supported |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Planned |
| Kimi CLI | Planned |
| Direct model API, bring your own key | Planned |

## Quick start

**1. Install the relay** on the machine your agent runs on.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://anywh.sh/install | sh
```

Linux and Apple Silicon macOS — on Windows, run it inside WSL2. The script downloads the latest release, verifies its checksum, and registers a systemd user service that comes back after a reboot. It installs nothing on your behalf: Node.js 20.12+ and an agent CLI you are already logged into have to be there first, and it stops with a clear message if either is missing.

**2. Install the client** on the device you actually use. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/anywh-sh/anywh/releases/latest) for Windows, macOS or Linux.

**3. Create your first profile** from the app. With nothing set up yet it opens on a first-run screen that walks you through reaching the relay and creating a profile — the agent login the relay serves. You need at least one; most people never need a second.

Building from source, iOS builds, creating profiles from the command line, and everything in between: [Self-hosting](./docs/self-hosting.md).

## Security model

The relay has no authentication and CORS is wide open. The threat model is a trusted network — your LAN, or a personal [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)/WireGuard network for remote access — not the public internet. Do not expose the relay's port directly.

This matters more than "no authentication" alone suggests: the relay's default permission mode is `bypassPermissions` (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`), so anyone who can reach the port can run arbitrary code as you, not merely read your conversations.

## Roadmap

- [x] Interactive file browser — browse, read, download, rename/delete, and open files in your editor (local or over SSH)
- [x] Multi-session and multi-profile support
- [ ] More agent CLIs — Codex CLI, Kimi CLI, and others beyond Claude Code
- [ ] Workspace isolation — a git worktree per session instead of a shared working directory, so several agents can work the same repo without stepping on each other
- [ ] Direct model access (BYOK) — talk to a model API with your own key instead of going through a CLI, same UI and session model either way

## Docs

- [Self-hosting](./docs/self-hosting.md) — the full install: relay, client, building from source, iOS
- [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md) — every environment variable on both sides, and what it changes
- [Remote access](./docs/remote-access.md) — reaching your relay from outside your LAN
- [Profiles](./docs/profiles.md) — more than one agent login on one machine
- [Themes](./docs/themes.md) — writing, importing and sharing a theme
- [Pairing protocol](./docs/pairing.md) — for a relay that is not directly reachable
- [Running as a systemd service](./infra/systemd/README.md) — the unit template, and provisioning from the command line
